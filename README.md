## Evaluating SVM Margin Maximization in Deep Neural Networks 

The project's repository contains 4 files on its main branch; README.md, Softmax_SVM_Code_EMNIST.ipynb, Softmax_Code_MNIST_FashionMNIST.ipynb, and SVM_Code_MNIST_FashionMNIST.ipynb. In this README.md file, we will detail the steps to take in running the project.

#### Running the Notebook Files

To run each file, we ask that you first download or clone them to your local machine. Once they have been downloaded, you may open them individually in your local Jupyter Lab environment or upload them to Google Colab (both environments are compatible with our files). From there, each notebook has instructions within them to explain how to run their cells individually and how to load their corresponding datasets.

#### The Softmax_Code_MNIST_FashionMNIST Notebook

This notebook contains the code and steps to deploy the CNN-Softmax model for the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. 

#### The SVM_Code_MNIST_FashionMNIST Notebook

This notebook contains the code and steps to deploy the CNN-SVM model for the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. 

#### The Softmax_SVM_Code_EMNIST Notebook

This notebook contains the code and steps to deploy both of the CNN-SVM and CNN-Softmax models only for the EMNIST dataset.
**Note:** including the EMNIST dataset in the Softmax_Code_MNIST_FashionMNIST and SVM_Code_MNIST_FashionMNIST notebooks caused our environments to repeatedly crash. As such, we've included it and its corresponding CNN models in its own notebook for ease of use and access.


We would also like to highlight that we took inspiration from A.F. Agarap's [An Architecture Combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Image Classification](https://github.com/AFAgarap/cnn-svm#an-architecture-combining-convolutional-neural-network-cnn-and-linear-support-vector-machine-svm-for-image-classification), 2017. Though we did not use the CNN architecture nor the code executed in this repository, we appreciate its application of the primary paper's assertions.
